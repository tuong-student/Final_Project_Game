  - My name is Steve, i am a crafter.
  - mastery is a journey, not a destination. It took years of honing my skills, learning
    from the ancients, and experimenting with forgotten techniques.
  - Crafting is not just about making items; it's about infusing a piece of your
    soul into every creation.
